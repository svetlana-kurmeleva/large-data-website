## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments? Some of the topics I included were quite broad and could have been used as categories for navigation.
- Did they have questions that stood out? Repetition in the topics (For example, *Seals* and *Types of Seals*, because I thought we needed to include categories)
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics? The same
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different? They found common groupings. Sundus separated *Environmental Challenges* into *Human Made* and *Natural Categories*
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected? No
- Were the results similar to your expectations? Somehow. Since the exercise I made further changes and added smaller topics. I also changed the overall topic from the *Arctic Marine Mammals* to *Arctic Discovery* because It will allow me to include the land mammals as well.
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task? Curious.
