Dispite ther distant relationship, all marine mammals share the common attribute of being predators that capture their prey on or in the oceans. All are relatively long lived, and virtually all are critical food resources to the indigenous peoples of the Arctic.

    				<p class="eco">Most of us will never visit the Arctic Circle — and the residents of this northernmost region are perfectly happy with that. We're not talking about Inuit; we're talking about the animals that call the Arctic home. Though the subzero temperatures and rugged boreal forests may seem bleak and unforgiving, many species thrive in the frigid tundra of the Arctic Circle.
