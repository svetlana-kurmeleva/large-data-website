    				<p class="eco">  There are 12 species of marine mammals that regularly inhabit the Arctic: 4 species of whales, the polar bear, the walrus, and 6 species of ice-associated seals, Several addtional species (e.g. Sperm whales, Blue whales, Fin Whales, Humpback Whales, Killer Whales, Harbor Porpoise) are spotted occasionally or even regularly within marginal waters of the Arctic. 

Dispite ther distant relationship, all marine mammals share the common attribute of being predators that capture their prey on or in the oceans. All are relatively long lived, and virtually all are critical food resources to the indigenous peoples of the Arctic.

             		<p>New evidence suggests that the polar bear, Ursus maritimus, or the sea bear, started to evolve about five million years ago from                    brown bear ancestors. Unlike their land-based cousins, polar bears are superbly adapted for survival in the Far North on a sea ice                    habitat.</p>

    				<p class="eco">Most of us will never visit the Arctic Circle — and the residents of this northernmost region are perfectly happy with that. We're not talking about Inuit; we're talking about the animals that call the Arctic home. Though the subzero temperatures and rugged boreal forests may seem bleak and unforgiving, many species thrive in the frigid tundra of the Arctic Circle.
