    				<p><strong><span class="uppercase">Discover the Arctic environment</span></strong> and its amazing wildlife with our new and        informative website. We hope you enjoy taking a look around; here you will find the staggering diversity of life that the Arctic hosts; you will discover everything you need to know about  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear" rel="external">polar bears,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whales" rel="external">whales,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped" rel="external">seals </a>and many, many more. We host a great deal of information covering the cultural, scientific and biological richness of the Arctic. Our other goal is to show you the delicate environmental balance that the Arctic ecosystem needs to prosper and the extreme environmental challenges that are now threatening wildlife with extinction and the very existence of the ice itself.

    				<p ><strong><span class="uppercase">The Arctic is a polar region</span></strong>  located at the northernmost part of the Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean and parts of Canada, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean, surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as north of the Arctic Circle (66° 33'N), the approximate limit of the midnight sun and the polar night. Alternatively, it can be defined as the region where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below 10 °C (50 °F); the northernmost tree line roughly follows the isotherm at the boundary of this region.

             		<p>The Arctic's climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. The Arctic's annual precipitation is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in). High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can be as low as −40 °C (−40 °F), and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately −68 °C (−90 °F).  The Arctic is affected by current global warming, leading to Arctic sea ice shrinkage and Arctic methane release.</p>

                    Plants</h2>
             		<p>Arctic vegetation is composed of plants such as dwarf shrubs, graminoids, herbs, lichens and mosses, which all grow relatively close to the ground, forming tundra. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in height; sedges, mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; non-vascular plants such as lichens and mosses predominate.</p>

    				<p class="eco">Socially and politically, the Arctic region includes the northern territories of the eight Arctic states, although by natural science definitions much of this territory is considered subarctic. The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. In recent years the extent of the sea ice has declined. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants and human societies.
