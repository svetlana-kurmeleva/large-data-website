    				<p><strong><span class="uppercase">Discover the Arctic environment</span></strong> and its amazing wildlife with our new and        informative website. We hope you enjoy taking a look around; here you will find the staggering diversity of life that the Arctic hosts; you will discover everything you need to know about  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear" rel="external">polar bears,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whales" rel="external">whales,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped" rel="external">seals </a>and many, many more. We host a great deal of information covering the cultural, scientific and biological richness of the Arctic. Our other goal is to show you the delicate environmental balance that the Arctic ecosystem needs to prosper and the extreme environmental challenges that are now threatening wildlife with extinction and the very existence of the ice itself.
