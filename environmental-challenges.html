             			<p>The Arctic matters to the rest of the planet - as the driver of many of the world's climate and ocean systems, as the homeland of Indigenous Peoples who have inhabited the region for thousands of years, and as the site of some of the world's largest remaining intact ecosystems.

At the same time, it is a place of rapid change. Ecosystems face increasing pressure from the combined effects of climate change, transboundary pollutants and increasing industrial development. Human societies across the Arctic are trying to respond to these changes in many ways. <a href="http://www.grida.no/polar/issues.aspx" rel="external">read more...</a></p>

                    	<h2 class="walrush2">Ship Traffic</h2>
             				<p> Less ice means more ship traffic related to industrial development, including offshore oil and gas and mining. It also increases access for supply vessels, scientific research boats and cruise ships during the summer season. According to Canadian Coast Guard records, the overall number of ships in Canada’s Arctic has increased an average of 35 percent since 2007.

More ship traffic in places such as Lancaster Sound affects the whales that use this route as a migratory highway in spring and fall. Collisions between ships and whales pose a substantial threat, especially for the bowhead whale population. Increased shipping increases the risk of shipping accidents, including spills. New northern shipping routes will also introduce alien species, pathogens and pollutants into a relatively pristine environment, much of it from ship ballast water. <a href="http://oceansnorth.org/future-marine-mammals-changing-arctic" rel="external">read more... </a>

                    	<h2 class="walrush2">Offshore Oil and Gas Development</h2>
             				<p> Oil and gas exploration is increasing in all Arctic countries. No Canadian oil and gas production is currently taking place in Baffin Bay or Davis Strait. Offshore exploratory drilling started in Greenland’s Baffin Bay waters in 2010 and additional oil leases have been sold. A spill or blowout from exploration or production anywhere in this region could jeopardize marine areas thousands of kilometres away. Even before drilling begins, the search for oil requires seismic testing that can have detrimental effects on marine mammals. Loud noises such as seismic blasts can cause hearing loss and disruption of feeding, migration, social bonding and reproductive success.  <a href="http://oceansnorth.org/future-marine-mammals-changing-arctic" rel="external">read more...</a>

                    <h2 class="walrush2">Commercial Fishing</h2>
             			<p>Baffin Bay is the site of extensive commercial fishing in both Greenland and Canada. Commercial fishing could harm healthy marine mammal populations through over-harvesting of fish that whales eat, physical destruction of key habitat and animals that collide with boats or become entangled in fishing gear. With so little known about the habitat of narwhal, it’s very difficult to determine whether current levels of fishing are sustainable for the overall ecosystem and that species. There’s also little information about the extent of regional cold water corals – increasingly recognized as rich habitat for many species even in icy, dark Arctic waters. Other factors that make it hard to predict how to set sustainable fishing levels are changes in fish populations, freshwater-saltwater mixing, the effects of ice loss on plankton blooms and increasing sea temperatures.</p>
