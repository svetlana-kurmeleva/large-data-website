				<p><strong><span class="uppercase">These marine mammals</span></strong> are extremely sociable, prone to loudly bellowing and snorting at one another. Walruses are distinguished by their long white tusks, grizzly whiskers, flat flipper, and bodies full of blubber. The mustached and long-tusked walrus is most often found near the Arctic Circle, lying on the ice with hundreds of companions.  </p>

                    <h2>Habitat</h2>
             			<p>The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the 				
                        Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of 	
                        Alaska, and in the waters between those locations. </p>
                    	<p>The much smaller population of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, and the western 	
                        part of Arctic Russia. In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the population of the northwest Atlantic walrus in 	
                        Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador as having been eradicated in Canada.</p>

                    <h2>Evolution</h2>
                    	<p>The walrus is a mammal in the order Carnivora. It is the sole surviving member of the family Odobenidae, one of three lineages
                        in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). Recent genetic evidence suggests all 
                        three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. </p><p>Two subspecies of walrus are widely recognized: the 
                        Atlantic walrus and the Pacific walrus. An isolated population in the Laptev Sea is considered by many Russian biologists and the canonical                        Mammal Species of the World, to be a third subspecies. </p>

                       <p>Walruses prefer molluscs - mainly bivalves such as clams. They also eat many other kinds of benthic invertebrates including worms,  
                       gastropods, cephalopods, crustaceans, sea cucumbers, and other soft-bodied animals. Walruses may occasionally prey on fishes such as polar  
                       cod.</p>
                       <ol class="diet">
                       		<li> Adult walruses eat about 3% to 6% of their total weight per day.</li>
                            <li> Adults may eat as many as 3,000 to 6,000 clams in a single feeding session.</li>
                            <li> In the summer months, and during the southward migration in the fall, walruses spend most of their day foraging. They eat less on                             their northward migration in the spring.  <a href=

                    	<h2 class="walrush2">Conservation</h2>
             				<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European 
                            sealers and whalers, leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population. Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed
                            throughout its range, although Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples continue to kill small numbers towards the end of each  
                            summer.</p>
                            <p>Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as "least-concern" by the IUCN, while the third is "data   
                            deficient".  <a href="http://seaworld.org/en/Animal-Info/Animal-InfoBooks/Walrus/Conservation-and-Research" rel="external">read more...</a></p>

    				<p class="bottom"><span class="uppercase">The walrus plays an important role</span> in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Because of its distinctive appearance, great bulk, and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal, particularly in English children's literature. Perhaps its best-known appearance is in Lewis Carroll's whimsical poem "The Walrus and the Carpenter" that appears in his 1871 book Through the Looking-Glass. The "walrus" in the cryptic Beatles song I Am the Walrus is a reference to the Lewis Carroll poem.
