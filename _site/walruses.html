             			<p>The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the 				
                        Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of 	
                        Alaska, and in the waters between those locations. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San 	
                        Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific 	
                        walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.</p>
                    	<p>The much smaller population of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, and the western 	
                        part of Arctic Russia. In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the population of the northwest Atlantic walrus in 	
                        Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador as having been eradicated in Canada.</p>

                    <h2 class="walrush2">Evolution</h2>
                    	<p>The walrus is a mammal in the order Carnivora. It is the sole surviving member of the family Odobenidae, one of three lineages
                        in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). Recent genetic evidence suggests all 
                        three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. </p><p>Recent multigene analysis indicates the 
                        odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 
                        15–20 million years ago.</p><p>Two subspecies of walrus are widely recognized: the Atlantic walrus and the Pacific walrus. An 
                        isolated population in the Laptev Sea is considered by many Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World, to 
                        be a third subspecies. </p>

                     <h2 class="walrush2">Diet</h2>
             			<!--<p>Walruses prefer shallow shelf regions and forage primarily on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms. They are not 
                        particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds; their deepest recorded dives are around 80 m (260 ft). They can remain 
                        submerged for as long as half an hour.</p>

                       <p>The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs,  
                       tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers 
                       benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey 
                       with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The walrus sucks the 
                       meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a                       vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.</p>-->
                       <p>Walruses prefer molluscs - mainly bivalves such as clams. They also eat many other kinds of benthic invertebrates including worms, gastropods, cephalopods, crustaceans, sea cucumbers, and other soft-bodied animals. Walruses may occasionally prey on fishes such as polar cod.</p>
                       <ol class="diet">
                       		<li> Adult walruses eat about 3% to 6% of their total weight per day.</li>
                            <li> Adults may eat as many as 3,000 to 6,000 clams in a single feeding session.</li>
                            <li> Observations of feedings indicate that walruses usually fill their stomachs twice daily.</li>
                            <li> In the summer months, and during the southward migration in the fall, walruses spend most of their day foraging. They eat less on their northward migration in the spring. Food intake for mature male walruses dramatically decreases during the breeding season and probably for a shorter time for females in estrus. Pregnant females increase food consumption about 30% to 40%. <a href="http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/walrus/diet.htm" rel="external">read more...</a></li>

                    	<h2 class="walrush2">Conservation</h2>
             				<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European sealers and whalers, leading to                            the near extirpation of the Atlantic population. Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although                            Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples continue to kill small numbers towards the end of each summer.</p>
                            <p>Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as "least-concern" by the IUCN, while the third is "data   
                            deficient". The Pacific walrus is not listed as "depleted" according to the Marine Mammal Protection Act nor as "threatened"                            or "endangered" under the Endangered Species Act. The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category                            2 (decreasing) and Category 3 (rare) in the Russian Red Book. Global trade in walrus ivory is restricted according to a CITES                            Appendix 3 listing.  <a href="http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/walrus/diet.htm" rel="external">read more...</a></p>

                    Culture</h2>
    				<p>The walrus plays an important role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Because of its distinctive appearance, great bulk, and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal, particularly in English children's literature. Perhaps its best-known appearance is in Lewis Carroll's whimsical poem "The Walrus and the Carpenter" that appears in his 1871 book Through the Looking-Glass. The "walrus" in the cryptic Beatles song I Am the Walrus is a reference to the Lewis Carroll poem.
