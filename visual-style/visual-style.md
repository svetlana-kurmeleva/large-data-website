# Arctic Discovery /Visual Style/

The choice of topic ultimately defines the choice of colour for my website. I wanted to go with a cooler palette which would include some variations of blue. For the first and the third style, the colours used are appropriate, but I find they are a little bit "washed out". I wanted them to be more vibrant and crisp in their combination, that is why I think that the shade of blue chosen for the second board combined with black is the most successful. 

The typography choice in the second board is more successful as well; the Futura font for the headline is similar to Universe, but not as rigid. I like its clean lines.  Overall, I will go with the second visual style, because the look is more effective.
